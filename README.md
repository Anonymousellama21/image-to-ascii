# image-to-ascii
turn an image into ascii art

usage:
python image-to-ascii-art.py <input_file> <horizontal_resolution> <vertical_resolution> <output_file> <optional color_settings (currently 1 or 0)>

I included 2 different color settings because sometimes it doesnt work very well with one of them
I think color setting 1 generally works better on clipart style things
